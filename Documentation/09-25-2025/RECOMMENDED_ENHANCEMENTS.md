- Test LLM prompt generation
- Test verdict parsing
- Test error handling
- Test data transformations
```

### Type Safety
```typescript
// Use branded types for IDs
type SubmissionId = string & { __brand: 'SubmissionId' };
type JudgeId = string & { __brand: 'JudgeId' };

// Use discriminated unions for results
type EvaluationResult = 
  | { status: 'success'; verdict: Verdict; reasoning: string }
  | { status: 'error'; error: string }
  | { status: 'pending' };
```

```typescript
// Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
// Use React.memo for expensive components
// Implement request debouncing
// Add caching layer for repeated evaluations
```

### Architecture
```typescript
// Implement repository pattern
// Add service layer abstraction
// Use dependency injection
// Implement event-driven updates
```
