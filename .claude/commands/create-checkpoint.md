# Create Checkpoint - AI Judge Development Session

Saves current AI Judge development progress for seamless continuation later.

# Usage

- `create-checkpoint` - Saves AI Judge development checkpoint

# Process

1. **Remove old checkpoint** - Clean up previous CHECKPOINT.md
2. **Analyze AI Judge progress** - Current feature implementation status
3. **Document project structure** - Show key directories and files
4. **Summarize implementations** - What features are complete/in-progress
5. **Capture technical decisions** - Database choice, LLM provider, patterns
6. **List remaining tasks** - What's needed for submission

**Create `CHECKPOINT.md` with:**

```markdown
# AI Judge Development Checkpoint - {{TIMESTAMP}}
